# "Carbon", AKA Greed
Carbon is one of the most important elements for us humans. It gives our cells structure, it allows the compounds we rely on to live to be possible, and it gives us a reason to exhale. Robots, on the other hand, don't need carbon in the slightest. They just think carbon-based minerals are cool!

## Getting Started
Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open 
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program 
by running the following commands.
```
dotnet build
dotnet run 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on 
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the 
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green 
arrow or "start debugging" button.
